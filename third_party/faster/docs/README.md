# Introduction

Welcome to FASTER. All documentation is now accessible via the web, at [https://aka.ms/FASTER](https://aka.ms/FASTER).

You can browse through the raw documentation markdown files via GitHub, if you prefer, by clicking 
[here](_docs/). Contributions and improvements are always welcome. Note that you will not have the
benefit of web navigational aids here, as these are the raw documentation sources.
